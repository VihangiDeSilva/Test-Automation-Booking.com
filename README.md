# Test Automation - Booking.com
This is test automation for the official [Booking.com](https://www.amazon.com/) website.

I've created an automation framework that simplifies the process of booking a hotel reservation. I've used the webdriverio automation framework along with JavaScript as the programming language to ensure efficient implementation. Additionally, I've integrated Mocha, a testing framework that promotes Behavior-Driven Development principles, to ensure thorough testing and collaboration.

## Challenges/Issues Faced in the Project:

- **Selector Strategy:**
In order to efficiently target elements, I adopted a combination of CSS selectors and XPath. CSS selectors were employed for straightforward element selections using classes, IDs, tag names, and hierarchy. This approach was chosen due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, for more intricate selections and cases where direct element properties fell short, XPath was utilized to address complex scenarios.

- **Object-Oriented Design:**
The project leveraged object-oriented programming principles. These concepts were employed to establish relationships between classes, facilitating code reuse and promoting modular design.

- **Learning Curve and Timeline:**
As a newcomer to automation, the project posed challenges owing to its complexity. Maneuvering through the intricacies of the project within the given timeframe demanded dedicated effort, especially considering the frequent updates on the booking.com website, where certain attributes are dynamic. Finding the correct element amidst these changes proved to be quite challenging. To overcome these challenges, I sought guidance from various learning resources, contributing to the completion of the project.
